								<p>Byhanka Cardoso is a Software Engineer with a strong networking and sales background. If you are looking for a hardworking, confident, and social Software Engineer you have come to the right place. As the child of Immigrant parents I was taught the value of hard work very young. Coming from Brazil and a very low income household, I watched my family work day and night to support us. This instilled a drive in me to always try my hardest and never give up.I became a mother at the age of 15, and notwithstanding the challenges, I remained resolute in pursuing a successful future. As an immigrant growing up in the United States, I knew the odds were against me, but I refused to let that hold me back. Despite facing numerous challenges, I persevered with unwavering determination and an unyielding commitment to success. In 2016, my hard work paid off when I successfully graduated from high school, and subsequently enrolled in college for business administration and management.</p>
								<p> Before embarking on this incredible career as a Software engineer, I used to be an insurance sales representative. Being in sales gave me a very strong networking and social background. I was forced to push myself out of my comfort zone and meet new people, network to build a strong client base where my customers trusted me and came to me with any questions or concerns. I began my software engineering career in 2023. I chose this career path for multiple reasons. It is an amazing work environment with endless growth opportunities (...the pay is not too bad either haha). As a young mother, having the ability to work remotely and have more time for my daughter has been the biggest blessing about this career. She is so happy to come home everyday from school and mom is always here waiting for her. It has given me an opportunity to grow in many ways. </p>
